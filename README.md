### Hello, wanderer.

---

Yeah, I know... this place feels a bit chaotic right now.  
Some repositories are outdated — a reflection of where I once was, not where I am now.  
Consider it a *"work in progress"* — evolving, just like everything else.

---

### What's Next at some point?

- **Reorganizing and cleaning up** the mess.
- **Republishing updated, polished projects** in the near future.
- **Staying focused on growth** and creating better work.

---

### Stay Tuned

Until then, feel free to look around or reach out.  
Good things take time — and they're on their way.
